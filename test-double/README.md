## Test Double
Definition of Test Double is almost as old as my masterâ€™s degree and can be found in this [book](https://www.amazon.com/xUnit-Test-Patterns-Refactoring-Code/dp/0131495054). Test Doubles are usefull to implement reliable and fast Unit Tests isolating [System Under Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_under_test) from external dependencies.

## Test Double types
* Dummy objects - used to fulfil consturctor or method arguments list, passed but not used otherwise 
* Stubs - return prepared answers to calls made during the test 
* Spies - are stubs enchanced with recording capability, can record method calls or information about system events like number of messages sent
* Mocks - on top what spies can do mocks are pre-programmed with expectations of return values, can throw exceptions for not supported scenarios and are check during verification for interaction correctnes
* Fake objects - most sophisticated dummy, this can be special implementation not suitable for production that can be used in testing for example: in memory cache, in memory database ...

### Trivia:
Test Double act just like movie stunt double - replacing "real" code and doing what need to be done :)
